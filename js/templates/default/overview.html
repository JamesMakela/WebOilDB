            <p>
                The Oil Database is a searchable repository of oils and other
                petroleum products.  It is intended to support a rich set of
                chemical properties, along with some analysis and comparison
                tools.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is derived from the NOAA ADIOS oil properties table, with
                the addition of new enhancements to the properties and new
                usability features.
