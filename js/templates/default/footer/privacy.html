    The Oil Library web application allows you to set up oil records that
    contain specified location information, however this information is limited
    to general regions, and we do not save or store this information unless
    requested to do so.
</p>

<p><strong>How Information is Used</strong></p>

<p>
    The information collected by the Oil Library web application is used
    primarily to aid in the research of petroleum chemical properties, and
    to be used as input to environmental models.  We make every effort to
    disclose clearly how information is used at the point where it is collected
    so that our users can determine for themselves whether they wish to provide
    the information.
</p>

<p><strong>Retention of Information</strong></p>

<p>
    The primary purpose of the Oil Library database is to retain records of oil
    properties.  We may retain these records for archival purposes.
</p>

<p><strong>Information Protection</strong></p>

<p>
    For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains
    available to all users, this computer system may employ software
    programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts
    to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
    If such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity,
    such evidence may be provided to appropriate law enforcement officials.
    Unauthorized attempts to upload or change information on this server are
    strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and
    Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection
    Act or other law.

</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>
    "Cookies" are small bits of text that are either used for the duration
    of a session ("session cookies"), or saved on a user's hard drive in order
    to identify that user, or information about that user, the next time
    the user logs on to a website ("persistent cookies").
    The Oil Library web application uses cookies that expire after 24 hours
    and does not use any other persistent tracking technology.
    Lastly, one or more of our component sites may use session cookies to
    provide streamlined navigation. These session cookies are deleted from the
    component's server after your session ends and information from them is
    not collected or saved. All information entered by the user into this
    application that is not part of an oil properties record, is only
    maintained until the Oil Library web application is closed.
    Some information is stored locally on the userâ€™s computer and will
    stay there unless manually deleted. This information is not saved on the
    server.
</p>

<p><strong>Interaction with Children</strong></p>

<p>
    No personally identifiable information is collected from children unless
    voluntarily submitted as a request for information or services, or as
    feedback on the Help sections of the Oil Library web application.
    The information collected is used to respond to user inquiries or to
    provide services requested by our users or to improve the Oil Library
    web application.
</p>

<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>

<p>
    The Oil Library web application uses Google Analytics, a third-party
    web measurement and customization technology. Google Analytics places
    a small file on your computer, commonly called a "cookie," so that it can
    recognize your computer if you visit the Oil Library web application
    in the future. This is considered a Tier 2 service.
</p>

<p>
    Google Analytics does not collect personally identifiable information
    through their cookie and does not combine, match, or cross-reference
    information from this website domain with any other information.
    Please review the provider's privacy policy for additional information,
    http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html (offsite link).
</p>

<p>
    Visitors who choose to disable this web measurement will still have
    full access to the Oil Library web application. While the details vary
    from browser to browsers, most modern browsers can be set up to accept,
    reject, or request user intervention when a site asks to set a cookie.
    Google Analytics uses a cookie that begins with: _utm.
